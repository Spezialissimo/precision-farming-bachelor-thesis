  abstract  = {Agriculture not only contributes to economic development and sustainability, but also is a significant factor in environmental sustainability. It is a leading source of water pollution, a profound disruptor of wildlife habitats, and a significant contributor of greenhouse gas emissions. It also shapes culturally important landscapes and amenities, fosters wildlife that depends on agroecosystems and sequesters carbon. Many of these impacts are difficult to measure, monitor, and attribute to specific sources, and this complicates the design of remedial policies. This article examines the economic foundations for contemporary analysis of agricultural policies related to natural resources and the environment.}

  abstract = {Water’s ability to generate value in irrigated agriculture remains poorly quantified at the global scale. The valuation of irrigation water is an important piece of information not only for agribusiness investors interested in the acquisition of land and water entitlements but also for farmers and rural communities that are negotiating with such investors. To make an informed decision about the acquisition or relinquishment of water rights or about investments in irrigation infrastructure there is a need for a better understanding of the value generated by irrigation water in agriculture using methods that rely on globally available data. This study provides a high-resolution global assessment of irrigation water value as a function of crop type and geographic location. Major environmental functions and human needs critically depend on water. In regions of the world affected by water scarcity economic activities can be constrained by water availability, leading to competition both among sectors and between human uses and environmental needs. While the commodification of water remains a contentious political issue, the valuation of this natural resource is sometime viewed as a strategy to avoid water waste. Likewise, water markets have been invoked as a mechanism to allocate water to economically most efficient uses. The value of water, however, remains difficult to estimate because water markets and market prices exist only in few regions of the world. Despite numerous attempts at estimating the value of water in the absence of markets (i.e., the “shadow price”), a global spatially explicit assessment of the value of water in agriculture is still missing. Here we propose a data-parsimonious biophysical framework to determine the value generated by water in irrigated agriculture and highlight its global spatiotemporal patterns. We find that in much of the world the actual crop distribution does not maximize agricultural water value.}

This work aimed at assessing the interrelation between EWE and agriculture through a systematic quantitative review of current scientific literature. The review analysed 19 major cropping systems (cereals, legumes, viticulture, horticulture and pastures) across five continents. Documents were extracted from the Scopus database and examined with a text mining tool to appraise the trend of publications across the years, the specific EWE-related issues examined and the research gaps addressed. The results highlighted that food security and economic losses due to the EWE represent a major interest of the scientific community. Implementation of remote sensing and imagery techniques for monitoring and detecting the effects of EWE is still underdeveloped. Large research gaps still lie in the areas concerning the effects of EWE on major cash crops (grapevine and tomato) and the agronomic dynamics of EWE in developing countries. Current knowledge on the physiological dynamics regulating the responses of main crops to EWE appears to be well established, while more research is urgently needed in the fields of mitigation measures and governance systems.},

  abstract = {With the world’s population set to increase by 65% (3.7 billion) by ∼2050, the additional food required to feed future generations will put further enormous pressure on freshwater resources. This is because agriculture is the largest single user of fresh water, accounting for ∼75% of current human water use. At present ∼7% of the world’s population live in areas where water is scarce. This is predicted to rise to a staggering 67% of the world’s population by 2050. Because of this water scarcity and because new arable land is also limited, future increases in production will have to come mainly by growing more food on existing land and water. This paper looks at how this might be achieved by examining the efficiency with which water is used in agriculture. Globally, in both irrigated and rain fed agriculture only about 10–30% of the available water (as rainfall, surface or groundwater) is used by plants as transpiration. In arid and semi-arid areas, where water is scarce and population growth is high, this figure is nearer 5% in rain fed crops. There is, therefore, great potential for improving water use efficiency in agriculture, particularly, in those areas where the need is greatest. The technical basis for improving agricultural water use efficiency is illustrated. This may be achieved by increasing the total amount of the water resource that is made available to plants for transpiration and/or by increasing the efficiency with which transpired water produces biomass. It is concluded that there is much scope for improvement, particularly, in the former and that future global change research should shift its emphasis to addressing this real and immediate challenge.}

This paper explores the importance of those additional climatic variables other than temperature and precipitation. Using the county-level agricultural data from 1980 to 2010 in China, we find that those additional climatic variables, especially humidity and wind speed, are critical for crop growth. Therefore, omitting those variables is likely to bias the predicted impacts of climate change on crop yields. In particular, omitting humidity tends to overpredict the cost of climate change on crop yields, while ignoring wind speed is likely to underpredict the effect. Our preferred specification indicates that climate change is likely to decrease the yields of rice, wheat, and corn in China by 36.25%, 18.26%, and 45.10%, respectively, by the end of this century.},

  abstract  = {Agricultural productivity in arid or semiarid environments cannot be sustained without adequate irrigation. Farmers require tools to assist them in making decisions about when and how much water to apply to their crops in order to make effective use of irrigation systems. However, at the moment, farmers make these decisions primarily on the basis of their previous experience and/or limited weather information. When irrigation systems are not used properly, they can lead to mismanagement of available fresh water, crop yield compromises, and direct reductions in farmers' financial returns, besides adverse effects for environmental sustainability. This chapter presents a systematic review of irrigation methods and precision irrigation technology. Based on the review, it was deduced that precision irrigation is still in its early stages in Pakistan and the rest of the world. Irrigation as a part of precision agriculture systems, or precision irrigation has received little attention, even though there has been widespread advocacy and application of precision agriculture in dry land regions. Furthermore, the potential of precision irrigation has not been evaluated, despite widespread promotion and implementation of precision agriculture. In this chapter, we have identified key challenges and opportunities for adaptation of precision irrigation and are suggesting future research directions for precision irrigation systems, trying to bridge the research–practice gap.}

  abstract = {Abstract The developments of information and automation technologies have opened a new era for weed management to fit physical and chemical control treatments to the spatial and temporal heterogeneity of weed distributions in agricultural fields. This review describes the technologies of site-specific weed management (SSWM) systems, evaluates their ecological and economic benefits and gives a perspective for the implementation in practical farming. Sensor technologies including 3D cameras, multispectral imaging and Artificial Intelligence (AI) for weed classification and computer-based decision algorithms are described in combination with precise spraying and hoeing operations. Those treatments are targeted for patches of weeds or individual weed plants. Cameras can also guide inter-row hoes precisely in the centre between two crop rows at much higher driving speed. Camera-guided hoeing increased selectivity and weed control efficacy compared with manual steered hoeing. Robots combine those guiding systems with in-row hoeing or spot spraying systems that can selectively control individual weeds within crop rows. Results with patch spraying show at least 50\% saving of herbicides in various crops without causing additional costs for weed control in the following years. A challenge with these technologies is the interoperability of sensing and controllers. Most of the current SSWM technologies use their own IT protocols that do not allow connecting different sensors and implements. Plug \& play standards for linking detection, decision making and weeding would improve the adoption of new SSWM technologies and reduce operational costs. An important impact of SSWM is the potential contribution to the EU-Green Deal targets to reduce pesticide use and increase biodiversity. However, further on-farm research is needed for integrating those technologies into agricultural practice.},

  abstract = {Optimization of irrigation scheduling is a widely proposed solution to enhance agricultural water productivity and mitigate water scarcity. However, there is currently a lack of knowledge about how to most effectively optimize and adapt irrigation decisions under weather and climate uncertainty, or about how the benefits of adaptive irrigation scheduling compare to fixed heuristics commonly used by farmers. In this article, we assess the added value of in-season adaptation of irrigation strategies in comparison to a fixed irrigation strategy that maximizes average profits over a range of plausible weather outcomes, but is not adjusted year-to-year. To perform this assessment, the AquaCrop-OSPy crop-water model is used to simulate a case study of irrigated maize production in a water scarce region in the central United States. Irrigation strategies are defined that maximize mean seasonal profit over a range of historical years. This baseline profit is then compared to the case of adaptive strategies, where the irrigation strategy is re-optimized at multiple stages within each season. Our analysis finds that fixed irrigation heuristics on average achieve over 90 % of potential profits attained with perfect seasonal foresight. In-season adaptation marginally increased agricultural profitability, with greater benefits found when re-optimization occurs more frequently or is accompanied by reliable forecasts of weather for the week ahead. However, the overall magnitude of these additional benefits was small (<5 % further increase in average profits), highlighting that fixed irrigation scheduling rules can be near-optimal when making realistic assumptions about farmers’ potential knowledge of future weather. Since fixed irrigation strategies are easier to design, communicate and implement than data-driven adaptive management strategies, we suggest that implementing these fixed strategies be prioritized over the development of more complex adaptive strategies.}

Crop simulation models offer a research tool for evaluating trade-offs of these potential adaptations and can form the basis of decision-support systems for farmers, and tools for education and training. We suggest that there are four areas in adapting crops and cropping systems that crop modelling can contribute: determining where and how well crops of the future will grow; contributing to crop improvement programmes; identifying what future crop management practices will be appropriate and assessing risk to crop production in the face of greater climate variability.}

Plant breeding focuses on developing superior genotypes with available genetic and nongenetic resources, and improved plant-breeding methods maximize genetic gain and cost-effectiveness. Computer simulation can lay out the breeding process in silico and identify optimal candidates for various scenarios; empirical validation can then follow. Insights gained from empirical studies, in turn, can be incorporated into computer simulations. In this review, we discuss different applications of computer simulation in plant breeding. First, we briefly summarize the history of plant breeding and computer simulation and how computer simulation can facilitate the breeding process. Next, we partition the utility of computer simulation into different research areas of plant breeding, including breeding method comparison, genetic mapping, gene network and genotype-by-environment interaction simulation, and crop modeling. Then we discuss computational issues involved in simulation. Finally, we offer some perspectives on the future of computer simulation in plant breeding.}

  abstract = {Vegetable growers in Europe are continually under increasing pressure to optimize irrigation and nutrient management. This results from the widespread effects of climate change and of competition from other sectors for water, and increasing societal pressure to reduce nutrient contamination of water bodies. The widespread and growing adoption of drip irrigation and fertigation provides vegetable growers with the technical infrastructure for greatly improved irrigation and nutrient management. However, quantitative decisions to achieve optimal irrigation and nutrient management, and increasingly of the two together, require complex decision-making. Numerous factors regarding climate, soil characteristics, field infrastructure, and crop characteristics need to be considered. Decision Support Systems (DSSs) and simulation models are tools that process large and diverse amounts of information to provide irrigation and nutrient recommendations that are specific to individual crops and sites. Commonly, DSSs incorporate simulation models, which enables site and crop specific assessment, and the possibility for dynamic responses to fluctuations in climate etc. There is an on-going trend for web-based DSSs that can access on-line data bases such as of climate and soil data, and that users consult with smartphone Apps. This article firstly reviews several general aspects regarding the use of DSSs/models in commercial vegetable production, such as how to enhance their user-friendliness. Subsequently, it describes DSSs/models that have been developed or are being used to assist with irrigation or nutrient management, or both, of vegetable crops. The most relevant aspects of these DSSs/models are highlighted. In addition to DSSs/models for practical on-farm management, the use of DSSs/models for scenario analysis to demonstrate theoretical case studies to policy makers, growers and advisors is discussed. A focus throughout is on how to make these products attractive and effective to potential users. The geographical focus is on Europe; however, particularly relevant cases from elsewhere are also considered. With the current state of Information and Communication Technology (ICT), and considering the inevitable future developments, DSSs can provide vegetable growers with effective and user-friendly tools to assist them to optimize irrigation and nutrient management.}

  abstract = {Agriculture, or farming, is the science of cultivating the soil, growing crops, and raising livestock. Ever since the days of the first plow from sticks over ten thousand years ago, agriculture has always depended on technology. As technology and science improved, so did the scale at which farming was possible. With the popularity and growth of the Internet of Things (IoT) in recent years, there are even more avenues for technology to make agriculture more efficient and help farmers in every nation. In this paper, we designed a smart IoT-enabled drip irrigation system using ESP32 to automate the irrigation process, and we tested it. The ESP32 communicates with the Blynk app, which is used to collect irrigation data, manually water the plants, switch off the automatic watering function, and plot graphs based on the readings of the sensors. We connected the ESP32 to a soil moisture sensor, temperature sensor, air humidity sensor, and water flow sensor. The ESP32 regularly checks if the soil is dry. If the soil is dry and the soil temperature is appropriate for watering, the ESP32 opens a solenoid valve and waters the plants. The amount of time to run the drip irrigation system is determined based on the flow rate measured by the water flow sensor. The ESP32 reads the humidity sensor values and notifies the user when the humidity is too high or too low. The user can switch off the automatic watering system according to the humidity value. In both primary and field tests, we found that the system ran well and was able to grow green onions.},

However, perceiving real-time crop water requirements remains a challenge. This research aims at field validating and exploiting a low-cost IoT soil moisture tensiometer prototype to consequently compare weather-based irrigation to soil water moisture-based irrigation in terms of yield and crop water productivity. The prototype is based on the ESP32 microcontroller and BMP180 barometric sensor. When compared to a mechanical tensiometer, the IoT prototype proved its accuracy, registering an average R2 equal to 0.8 and an RMSE range of 4.25–7.1 kPa. In a second step, the irrigation of a Romaine lettuce field (Lactuca sativa L.) cultivated under a drip system was managed according to two different scenarios: (1) using the data feed from the IoT tensiometers, irrigation was performed to keep the soil water potential between −15 and −25 kPa; (2) using the data provided by the in-situ weather station to estimate the crop water requirements. When comparing the yield, no significant difference was registered between the two scenarios. However, the water productivity was significantly higher, registering a 36.44% increment in scenario 1. The experiment highlights the water-saving potential achievable through real-time monitoring of soil moisture conditions. Since it is a low-cost device (82.20 USD), the introduced prototype facilitates deploying and managing a fleet of sensors for soil water potential live mapping.},

The agriculture sector of Anuradhapura district, Sri Lanka, well renowned for its pivotal role in the nation's food production, faces an increasing threat from the changing climate. This study aims to incorporate the indicator system method which uses a set of indicators to assess the agricultural vulnerability (AV) to climate change in Anuradhapura district. The AV assessment used in this study involves three principal components exposure, sensitivity, and adaptive capacity. The indicators are normalized to allow spatial analysis and smooth integration within a geographic information system (GIS) framework. The AV of Anuradhapura district ranged from 0.32 to 0.67 and was divided among five levels very low, low, moderate, high, and very high. The findings suggest that Anuradhapura's agricultural sector was significantly impacted by climate change as the majority of the total area was found to have very high, high, and moderate levels of AV with 25, 28, and 24{\%}, respectively. The results obtained from this study are essential for formulating plans to improve Anuradhapura's agricultural sector resilience and adaptability to ensure food security and livelihood sustainability considering the ever-changing climate.},

This study maps the articles published from January 2000 to May 2022 implementing crop vulnerability curves to weather-related extreme events and climate change. Fifty-two articles have been identified through the use of Scopus, Web of Science, Google Scholar and the references of the selected papers. The selected papers have been analysed to determine for which extreme events vulnerability curves have been proposed, which crops have been studied, which explanatory variables have been used to create the curves, which functions are used to develop vulnerability curves and the number of parameters on which the proposed functions rely. Comparisons among the vulnerability curves for the various extremes are proposed, as well as indications of the main drawback of the developed vulnerability curves. Finally, areas where further research is needed are proposed together with recommendations on which elements should be included in vulnerability curve development.},

The fragmentation process determines the particle size distribution of the soil. The transformation of particles volumes into pore volumes via a power function and the adoption of the capillarity equation lead to an expression for the water retention curve. This expression presents two fitting parameters only. The proposed model is tested on water retention data sets of 12 soils representing a wide range of soil textures, from sand to clay. The agreement between the fitted curves and the measured data is very good. The performances of the model are also compared with those of the two-parameter models of van Genuchten [1980] and Russo [1988] for the water retention function. In general, the proposed model exhibits increased flexibility and improves the fit at both the high and the low water contents range.},

  abstract = {This paper aims to provide a state-of-the-art review on the effects of vegetation roots on the soil structure and soil hydraulic properties. After a thorough review of current studies, the effects of vegetation roots are summarized into four: root exudation, root penetration, root water uptake and root decay. Root exudates alter the size and stability of aggregates, the contact angle of soil, and the viscosity and surface tension of pore fluid; root exudates of crops always increase the soil water retention capacity and decrease the soil saturated hydraulic conductivity. Root penetration creates new pores or clogs existing pores during root growth, and root parameters (e.g., root biomass density, root diameter and root length density) are well correlated to soil hydraulic properties. Root water uptake can apparently increase the soil water retention capacity by providing an additional negative pressure and induce micro-fissures and macropores in the rhizosphere soil. Root decay modifies the pore structure and water repellency of soil, resulting in the increase of soil macro-porosity, soil water retention, and the saturated hydraulic conductivity or steady infiltration rate. Some of the above four effects may be difficult to be distinguished, and most importantly each is highly time-dependent and influenced by a multitude of plant-related and soil-related factors. Therefore, it remains a significant challenge to comprehend and quantify the effects of vegetation roots on the soil structure and soil hydraulic properties. Unsolved questions and disputes that require further investigations in the future are summarized in this review.}

  abstract = {Smart Farming is a development that emphasizes the use of information and communication technology in the cyber-physical farm management cycle. New technologies such as the Internet of Things and Cloud Computing are expected to leverage this development and introduce more robots and artificial intelligence in farming. This is encompassed by the phenomenon of Big Data, massive volumes of data with a wide variety that can be captured, analysed and used for decision-making. This review aims to gain insight into the state-of-the-art of Big Data applications in Smart Farming and identify the related socio-economic challenges to be addressed. Following a structured approach, a conceptual framework for analysis was developed that can also be used for future studies on this topic. The review shows that the scope of Big Data applications in Smart Farming goes beyond primary production; it is influencing the entire food supply chain. Big data are being used to provide predictive insights in farming operations, drive real-time operational decisions, and redesign business processes for game-changing business models. Several authors therefore suggest that Big Data will cause major shifts in roles and power relations among different players in current food supply chain networks. The landscape of stakeholders exhibits an interesting game between powerful tech companies, venture capitalists and often small start-ups and new entrants. At the same time there are several public institutions that publish open data, under the condition that the privacy of persons must be guaranteed. The future of Smart Farming may unravel in a continuum of two extreme scenarios: 1) closed, proprietary systems in which the farmer is part of a highly integrated food supply chain or 2) open, collaborative systems in which the farmer and every other stakeholder in the chain network is flexible in choosing business partners as well for the technology as for the food production side. The further development of data and application infrastructures (platforms and standards) and their institutional embedment will play a crucial role in the battle between these scenarios. From a socio-economic perspective, the authors propose to give research priority to organizational issues concerning governance issues and suitable business models for data sharing in different supply chain scenarios.}
